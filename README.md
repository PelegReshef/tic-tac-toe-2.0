# tic tac toe.
Hi everyone (probably no one),

This is a Tic Tac Toe game I’m creating as a learning project in C#.  
As of May 2025, I’ve been learning C# for about 2 months.

Right now, the program may not work perfectly on all screen sizes —  
it might give errors or have messed-up visuals if the console window is too small. 
Hopefully, I’ll fix this soon!

Use the arrow and WASD keys to move, space to press a button or mark a cell.

Thanks for checking it out! :)

Edit (31/5/25): The program should work now for anyone whose monitor size is low-medium to large.

## Final Version (hopefully)

Tic Tac Toe 2.0 — Final Release
This project is now complete. Here are the features:


### Bot Difficulties

- Easy – plays randomly.
- Medium – blocks the player's winning moves and takes wins when available.
- Hard – uses the Minimax algorithm to play perfectly. It cannot be beaten.

### Engine

During your turn, pressing the E key activates an in-game engine that shows:
- Which available moves are guaranteed wins - in green
- Which moves result in a draw - in yellow
- Which moves lead to a loss - in red

### To Conclude
This is my first "real" coding project, and I'm really proud of how it turned out :)

if you find a bug or have a suggestion, you can contact me here though I dont promise a fix.
#### Hope you enjoyed!
