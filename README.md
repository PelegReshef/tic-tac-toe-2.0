# tic tac toe.
Hi everyone (probably no one 😊),

This is a Tic Tac Toe game I’m creating as a learning project in C#.  
As of May 2025, I’ve been learning C# for about 2 months.

Right now, the program may not work perfectly on all screen sizes —  
it might give errors or have messed-up visuals if the console window is too small or too big.  
Hopefully, I’ll fix this soon!

Thanks for checking it out! :)
